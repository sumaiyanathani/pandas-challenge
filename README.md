# pandas-challenge

In this challenge, I used the pandas library to analyse the data from schools. It was used in order to create multiple summaries of the given data from which we could draw conclusions about how students performed.

Various functions were used such as groupby, which was used to create groups of certain variables and then extract statistics based on these groups such as mean. Schools were also categorized based on how much they spent and how many students the schools had. For this, bins, labels and pd.cut was used. Data was filtered by slicing the main dataset on certain parameters. Lastly, the sort_values function was used to sort the data in ascending or descending order to determine how well the students from certain schools performed. 

The main report generated from the data can be found in the PyCitySchoolsAnalysis jupyter notebook which is located in the PyCitySchools folder in the repository.
